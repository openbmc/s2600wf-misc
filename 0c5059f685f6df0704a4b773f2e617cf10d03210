As general rule any resources we allocated as part of a class, we are supposed to clear when we exit(in destructor).\nBut here, we are knowingly allowing some copy of the shared_ptr class variable to remain even after deleting the class object.\n\nWhat if the new class object created another interface? the interface may get duplicated.\nOtherwise, if its a common interface and not associated to Backplane, then it doesn\u0027t need to a class variable for Backplane.",
